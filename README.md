# react-weather-app
This is a light weight and responsive web application that works with the weather API located at https://www.metaweather.com/api/.

The front-end was built using ReactJS, HTML5, CSS. 

The user can specify a place in the world from the front-end by typing in a location name (such as London) into a text field which offers typeahead functionality and auto suggests major cities. 

The application makes live calls to the API and retrieve the relevant weather information for the selected city (today and 5-day forecast).
